# Master Yoda's Class - Course Recommendation & Allotment System

A C-based terminal project that simulates a university-level course recommendation, choice filling, and allotment system, tailored by CGPA and student interests â€” complete with waitlisting, faculty lookup, and eligibility filters.

---

## Features

- User authentication with credentials stored securely in `data.csv`
- Personalized course recommendations based on student CGPA and selected interests
- Choice filling for up to 6 courses with preference ranking
- Faculty inquiry system to explore instructor details
- Allotment system with handling for waitlist and final course confirmations
- Eligibility checks for department, semester, and minimum CGPA
- CSV-based storage: lightweight and file-driven data persistence

|------------------------|---------|
| `main.c`               | Entry point of the application |
| `list.csv`             | Master list of all available courses |
| `data.csv`             | Registered user details |
| `choice_list.csv`      | Stores student choices and preferences |
| `Allotment.csv`        | Final allotted courses |
| `Waitlist.csv`         | Waitlisted students |
| `faculty_list.csv`     | Faculty information for lookup |
| `color.c`              | ANSI color-coded printing (UX improvements) |
| `CourseAllotments.csv` | Raw mapping of course choices and students |

## Future Improvements
- Implement password hashing and encryption (e.g., `sha256` or `bcrypt`) for enhanced security
- Develop an admin dashboard for analytics, allotment control, and real-time seat tracking
- Add a GUI frontend using Tkinter, React, or ncurses for better usability
- Integrate basic NLP to cluster student interests for smarter recommendations
- Enable persistent session handling across logins
- Expand to a mobile or full-stack web application for broader accessibility
